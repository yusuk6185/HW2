		<div><p><H3>My Story</H3></p><p>I was born in Seoul, South Korea and moved to Iksan City at the age of 7. I went to Yeongdeung Primary School and Hwasan Middle School in Iksan. After that, I came back to Seoul at 2010 and graduated Gwacheon High School in 2014. I failed to go to the university that I wanted. So, I decided to prepare to go to university abroad. I found that a program called GAC have sent a number of students to the universities in United States. The course was one year program and I made it to University of Iowa at 2015. When I got to Iowa, many people persuaded me to major in Actuarial Science which is about Statistics. I wasn't sure what I wanted to do at that time and persuaded. After two years of studying, I felt Actuarial Science is not my way and decided to find a major that suits me. So, now I'm studying Information Systems that makes me enjoy the study. It was a long journey to get here, but I like that I am finally studying what I can enjoy. </p><p></p><p>My hobby is playing video games and watching movies. I play with desktop rather than consoles like Xbox. I built my own desktop and it became one of my hobbies. Sometimes I help my friends build their desktops. The games I usually play are League of Legends, PUBG, and FIFA18. I am kind of competitive person who play hard to get a high rank. Sometimes I am worried of my play time because it could hurt my grade. Another hobby I have is traveling. I go on a trip on every break. I have been to most of the big cities in United States including LA, Vegas, Miami, Chicago, NYC and so on.</p></div>
